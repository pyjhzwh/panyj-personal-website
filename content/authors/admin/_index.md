I am a PhD student in computer architecture at University of Michigan CCCP(Compilers Creating Custom Processors) lab. My research insterests includes computation reduction and acceleration of CNN, hardware-aware pruning for CNN. I am advised by [Professor Scott Mahlke](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mahlke/).
